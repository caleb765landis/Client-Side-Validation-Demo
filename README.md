# Client Side Validation Demo

An example of client-side form validation using jQuery. This website is a sample portfolio page that I designed, with a contact form at the bottom with several different types of input. The project uses jQuery to validate the various inputs of this form, and output the information to the user. The data collected from this form is not stored in any way, only outputted directly back to the user. This project was created as a final project for my _Introduction to Client-Side Programming_ class at IUPUI. The page can be viewed by hosting the project on a local server.
